      "The article titled \"My take on the early Brexit winners and losers\" was written by Ian Bremmer and originally appeared on Facebook. It was later published on CNBC on June 24, 2016. Ian Bremmer is the president and founder of Eurasia Group, a professor at New York University, and the author of \"Superpower: Three Choices for America's Role in the World.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In the article, Bremmer discusses the winners and losers of the early stages of the Brexit campaign. He highlights Boris Johnson, the former London mayor and \"Leave\" supporter, who has now become a front-runner to lead the Tory party. Bremmer also mentions Theresa May, the UK Home Secretary, as a potential successor to outgoing Prime Minister David Cameron, given her political heavyweight status and respect among the Tories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nigel Farage, the leader of the UK Independence Party, is also mentioned as a winner, as he gets to keep having a political career and quoted \"Independence Day\" in his victory speech. Bremmer suggests that the success of divisive politics in the Brexit campaign may bode well for Donald Trump in the US presidential election.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the article provides an analysis of the early winners and losers in the Brexit campaign, offering insights into the political landscape at that time.\n"
